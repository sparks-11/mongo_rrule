# mongo_rrule
mongodb recursion method


make a copy of a code and run in vs code

in server.js file contains a list object which goes to the body

end to create localhost:1337/create post call with list as a body

if we have record in db it will throw err else it will create the record in the db 

now i'm clearing the db so you can create the record as per the listed days mon and tue

later try to create the same record with same date it will throw error 

after you can change the days in the value of list and try to create.

notes:

the above code is only for day recurring not for period of time 
and its not sensitive to time but its sensitive to days
